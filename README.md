# TV Prize Show 

# Problem Statement
Assume that you are on a TV-show where you can win money by picking the right box.
The host shows you three boxes and explains that one of them contains money.
Then the host asks you to pick a box without opening it. 
When you have selected a box the host opens one of the other two boxes which will be empty. 
Now you get the question if you want to change your choice or stick to your original choice of box. 


# Build
This is a Java Based application using maven as a build tool.
Extract the zip file and run mvn clean install to build.

# Run
Start playing the game with choosing any box from 1 to 3.
The game runs in a simulation of 1000 using different scenarios.

# Test with simulation
In order to calculate the winning percentage the GameSimulationTest.java can be run.
The number of boxes for now are 3 and is run against 10000 simulations.
